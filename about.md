# About

I am an undergraduate student of Electronics and Communication Engineering at BITS Pilani, Goa, India. I am interested in exploring the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience, specifically, using computational models to derive deeper insights into mechanisms of natural intelligence such as perception and decision making. <br>
Currently, my projects are spread across Reinforcement Learning, Computational Cognitive Neuroscience, Graph Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
